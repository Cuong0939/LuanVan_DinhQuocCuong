PLAN 
A. CODE (Estimated to be completed before OCT)
  STAGE 1 - Try with a single line text
    1. Create the datasets
    2. Preprocessing datasets 
    3. Prepare enviroment
    4. Make model
    5. Train mode
    6. Evalute model
    7. Make predict with test datasets
    8. Make predict with realtime examples


  STAGE 2 - Recognite the text fields on the feedback (Estimated to be completed before end of OCT)
    1. Recognite text fields on the feedback
    2. Extract the image of these text fields
    3. Preprocessing the images
    4. Test with the model which is made on stage 1
    5. Improve model (necessary)

  STAGE 3 - Make an app/web by python to visualize the result with orders (Estimated to be completed before Nov)
    1. Input is the feedback's image
    2. load model and preprocessing the input image
    3. Output are informations of feedback (include whole text on feedback) and visualize by JSON format
